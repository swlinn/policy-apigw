# JWE Decrypt Policy

The JWE Decrypt Policy policy can be used in IBM API Connect to decrypt
an encrypted payload for REST APIs. The content type of the decrypted message could be any content type,
and the policy will set the output content type header to either application/json, application/xml, or
text/plain based upon inspection of the decrypted payload.

The policy yaml may be included in a gateway extension zip file, referenced by the extension's
manifest.json file with a type of `user-defined-policy-yaml`, and will be deployed globally for
all catalogs in the Gateway. See https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/api-connect/10.0.1.x?topic=gateway-extensions-manifest
for additional detail.

It may also be deployed to a specific catalog by using the API manager and navigating to the catalog's
settings and using the upload button on an api gateway's policy view page. See https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/api-connect/10.0.1.x?topic=apdag-defining-packaging-publishing-catalog-scoped-policy-api-gateway
section 3, bullet point 3 for detailed instructions. It may also be deployed using the API Connect Toolkit. See
https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/api-connect/10.0.1.x?topic=policies-apic-policiescreate for detailed instructions.

## Usage

    The policy has the following properties:
    - Input Message:
        This is an optional property. Specify the name of the API Gateway context message to use as input to the policy.
        If not specified, the `message` context message will be assumed. The input payload will be taken from the context
        message's .body property.
    - Output Message:
        This is an optional property. Specify the name of the API Gateway context message to save the output of the policy.
        If not specified, the `message` context message will be assumed. If a context message name is provided that does
        not exist, it will be created. The output payload will be written to the context message's .body property. The context
        message's headers.content-type will be set based upon the payload that is decrypted.
    - Key Encryption Algorithm:
        This is a required property. Select a key encryption algorithm to be used for the decryption.  Choose from the following:
        - RSA1_5
        - RSA-OAEP
        - RSA-OAEP-256
        - A128KW
        - A192KW
        - A256KW
    - Crypto Object:
        This is a required property. Specify the name of the DataPower Crypto object used to decrypt the message. Note that:
        - The Crypto Object referenced must be the associated Crypto Key (private key)
        - The private key file must be referenced by the Crypto Key object provided.

## Inputs

    - JSON object containing an encrypted payload to be decrypted

## Outputs

    - Plain text decrypted result

## Prerequisites

    - IBM API Management 10.0.1.0 or later
    - IBM DataPower 10.0.1.0 or later
    - The Crypto Objects referenced by the policy and associated files must be present in the IBM API Connect domain on the DataPower Gateway
